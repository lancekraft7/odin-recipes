      <h4>Spaghetti a la familia</h4>
      <p>Here we have the spaghetti recipe my grandfather taught my father when he was a young lad. His mother would make it as the bombs fell on the allied shelters they were huddled in during WWII.
         My father in turn taught it to me during the invasion of our homeland where we were huddled together for warmth beneath the earth and stone.
        I will then teach it to my son when the time come and there is great need for spaghetti to be handed down, though i pray there is no need for it in his liftetime.
